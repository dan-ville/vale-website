          <p>
            Long ago, when continents were yet joined and the people of Earth
            were eight tribes, one tribe fell to the temptation of power.
          </p>
          <p>
            They acquired great powers to turn into dark monsters and wage war
            on the other tribes. To survive, the tribes allied themselves with
            the Ancients, beast spirits from whom originated all animal
            life.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Ancients gave the seven tribes the power to shapeshift into
            spirit warriors, each resembling the respective animal of their
            likeness. Through their power, the seven tribes drove back the eigth
            tribe and banished them to the darkness outside the Vale.
          </p>
          <p>
            But when catastrophies begin again in the Vale, the tribes start to
            suspect the return of the banished tribe... and the coming of
            another war for the Vale.
          </p>
          <span style={{ textAlign: "center", color: 'rgb(255, 94, 0)'}}>
            Join the heroes of the Vale as they save humanity's broken society, defy destiny with half-hearted hopes, and bridge the gaps of history, all while fighting for trust in a world of lies.
