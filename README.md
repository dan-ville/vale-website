# The Vale 
A website to showcase the universe of my epic fantasy series, *The Vale* (which I am still writing). 

I made this as a project to practice my skills with design and React, and it also served to enhance another passion of mine: writing!

## What I'm learning
I learned the basics of using Typescript in React and also how to set up a small back-end for my project which connects to Airtable.. 

This is a single-page application made with React and Typescript, and I mimicked server-side rendering by using Airtable as a minimum viable database to display the characters, tribes, etc. I chose Airtable because of it's incredible GUI and because their API has a great JavaScript SDK. I was already using Airtable as a database for my book, and it doubled perfectly as a database for this web-dev project. Instead of setting up a new SQL or MongoDB database, Airtable made it simple to connect my already existing DB to a quickly put-together backend for my React project. I highly recommend Airtable to anyone, and it is in fact the tool that inspired me to become a developer.
