# The Vale 
A website to showcase the universe of my epic fantasy series, *The Vale* (which I am still writing). 

I made this as a project to practice my skills with design and React, and it also served to enhance another passion of mine: writing!

## What I'm learning
This is a single-page application made with React and Typescript, and I mimicked server-side rendering by using Airtable as a minimum viable database to display the characters, tribes, etc. It's a neat implementation that allows me to bypass the need for a proper back-end, which would have been a much bigger project, but the real reason I used Airtable is because I had already been using it to plan out my book! I highly recommend Airtable to anyone, and it is in fact the tool that inspired me to become a developer.
